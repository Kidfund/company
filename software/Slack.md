# Slack

We use [Slack](kidfund.slack.com "Slack") for:

* Group or p2p chat in the office and when we are remote
* Giphy
* [Standups](https://geekbot.io/ "Standups")
* Our [hubot, r2d2](https://github.com/Kidfund/r2d2 "hubot, r2d2") (where @timbroder really needs to document it's commands)
* We tend to go on "Do Not Disturb" mode at night, because [sleep is important](https://m.signalvnoise.com/being-tired-isn-t-a-badge-of-honor-fa6d4c8cff4e "sleep is important")

*We text once in a while. If you are going to be late or miss something, text*
